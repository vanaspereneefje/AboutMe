<h2>A funny story</h2>

<p>It was a night like any other hot night in July. The full moon was shining bright, lighting up the room my mother and me met for the first time. Little did we know that I wasn't the only one who came into people's lives that day... The fourth of july marked the beginning of a legend about a big green ogre, entering the hearts of millions of children. A legend was born.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>I took my first breath on the day the first Shrek movie came out in Belgium. A legend was born.</p>
